# a Heading 1

## a Heading 2

Almost 7 years ago after travelling the islands of the Cyclades alone, having swam with my phone in my pocket the first day, so really alone, I went to my grandfather's house in Galaksidi. 

### a Heading 3

I was transfixed. The myth of Atlantis was, and still is, my favourite.

And obviously scanned it, in 4 pieces, for your perusal.
