Almost 7 years ago after travelling the islands of the Cyclades alone, mobile means of communication destroyed by the sea on the first day, I finally found land and headed towards my grandfather's house in Galakseidi. 

Sadly it was the first time there after my grandfather had passed and it was time to go through his books, a fortune I claimed without challenge.

In the piles of 1960s travel guides, National Geographics, 10 kg thesauri and ancient Greek tragedies, I found a newspaper issue that gruncle George had kept for around 50 years. The massive illustration on the front page was a map of the island of Santorini known to the ancients as Thira, and the bold claim:

> Professor Agg. Galanopoulos reveals that the island of Santirini is the "Lost Continent", Atlantis.

I was transfixed. The myth of Atlantis was, and still is, one of favourites. I've always been eating up every piece of literature, movie and computer game about it (in case you haven't played that [Indiana Jones adventure][indiana-jones]). So I grabbed it and obviously [scanned it]({{ page.paper | prepend: site.baseurl }}), in a4 pieces, for the all of you who can read one third of the Rosetta Stone (that is the Greek third).

Was this a valid claim? Did Plato's travels to ancient Thira get somehow interpreted and written down as his accounts of visiting Atlantis?

I had to find some answers.

At the time I had no idea I would be working for the BBC in about 4 months. I hadn't even applied for the job. Cue the [BBC Timewatch Special - Atlantis: The Evidence][atlantis-docu]. In it, historian Bettany Hughes talks about the same claim which, on an old illustrated newspaper from the 60s, seemed ludicrous. If Atlantis was indeed ancient Thira, how did it become a myth? And how did it disappear.

BLAH!

The greatest earthquake that the ancient world had faced. Pumice was ...wide, ash and smoke reached all the way to Ireland.

Closer at home a great island was stading in the way of the aftermath, Crete. Home of the Minotaur and King Minos' Labyrinth, the jail that Icarus fled on wax wings.  

The Minoan society was devasted by the disastrous waves that reached their shores, (some contribute this to the destruction of their civilisation?) and they believed that the Gods where punishing them for their bad deeds.

BLAH!

There, in the Palace of Knossos in Crete, etched in stone I first saw this symbol. It depicts the Minoan mason's double axe hit by Poseidon's trident, illustrating the destruction of the Minoans by the wrath of the Sea God. I drew it quickly in my skecthbook failing of course to note down anything about the documentary. 7 years later, this year, that symbol was calling. After finishing the first pages of [Chapter 0: Clouds]({{site.baseurl}}/chapters/0) spent a whole day looking for that screenshot.

The danger sign on the top of the cliff is inspired by that etching found in the Palace of Knossos, linked to one of mine and my grandfather's favourite islands in the Cyclades, two of the greatest civilisations of the ancient Aegean world and somehow to the mystical Atlantean myth.

Meet **Marko**, **Simo** and **Ioanna** in Clouds, the first out of seventeen odd chapters from the graphic novel **iland** by [Rob Morgan](https://twitter.com/aboutthislater) and [Nikos Tsouknidas](https://twitter.com/tsoukn).

Our [first chapter]({{site.baseurl}}/chapters/0) is dedicated to all the girls and boys that climbed up a cliff and found the view way more frightening than they expected, and to everyone who has learned that you cannot leap a chasm in two steps.

Next time you see these three kids, they will look very different.
