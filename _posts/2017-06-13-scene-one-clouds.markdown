###Almost 7 years ago

...after travelling the islands of the Cyclades alone, having swam with my phone in my pocket the first day, so really alone, I went to my grandfather's house in Galaksidi. Sadly it was the first visit after my grandfather had died and it was time to go through his books, a fortune I claimed without challenge.

In the piles of 1960s travel guides, National Geographics, 5kilo thesauri and anciect greek tragedies I found a newspaper that gruncle George had kept for 50 years. The massive illustration on the front page was a map of the island of Santorini, known to the ancients as Thira, and the bold claim:

> Professor Agg. Galanopoulos reveals that the island of Santirini is the "Lost Continent", Atlantis.

I was transfixed. The myth of Atlantis was, and still is, my favourite. I've always been eating up every piece of literature, movie and computer game about it (in case you haven't played that [Indiana Jones adventure][indiana-jones]). So I grabbed it! And obviously scanned it, in 4 pieces, for your perusal.

Was this a valid claim though? Did Plato's travels to ancient Thira get mixed and got transferred somehow as his account of Atlantis?

I had to find some answers.

At the time I had no idea I would be working for the BBC in about 4 months. I hadn't even applied. Cue the [BBC Timewatch Special - Atlantis: The Evidence][atlantis-docu]. In it, historian Bettany Hughes talks about the same claim which, on an old illustrated newspaper from the 60s, seemed ludicrous. If it was indeed ancient Thira, how did this place become a myth? And how did it disappear.

The greatest earthquake that the ancient world had faced. Pumice was ...wide, ash and smoke reached all the way to Ireland.

Closer at home a great island was stading in the way of the aftermath, Crete. Home of the Minotaur and King Minos' Labyrinth, the jail that Icarus fled on wax wings.  

The Minoan society was devasted by the disastrous waves that reached their shores, (some contribute this to the destruction of their civilisation?) and they believed that the Gods where punishing them for their bad deeds.

...there I first saw this symbol etched in stone, in the Palace of Knossos in Crete. It depicts the Minoan mason's double axe hit by Poseidon's trident, illustrating the destruction of the Minoans by the wrath of the Sea God. I drew it quickly on my skecthbook failing of course to note down the right title of the documentary. 7 years later, this year,( I knew it was time to use it, and after finishing the first pages spent one day looking for that screenshot).

The danger sign on the top of the cliff is inspired by that etching in the Palace of Knossos, linked to one of mine and my grandfather's favourite islands in the Cyclades, two of the greatest civilisations of the ancient Aegean world, and somehow to the mystical Atlantean myth.

Meet **Marko**, **Simo** and **Ioanna** in our first scene, Clouds.

This is our first out of fifteen odd scenes of a long graphic novel project called **iland**.

It goes to all the girls and boys that climbed up a cliff and found the view to be way more frightening than they expected, and to everyone who has learned that you cannot leap over a chasm in two steps.

see you sooner.<br>Nikos
