A more accurate depiction of what Greeks celebrate today, and what ensued, can be found in [Mark Mazzower's book "Greece Hitler](amazon link and ad) etc."

But in the best book about ["The Greek Islands"](amazon link and ad) an equally __ yet more romantic Englishman, Lawrence Durrell, tells us on page 106:
  > "We had no right to feel like this, for the world had come to an end. Why then this happy fulfilment of quiet talk and laughter? The reason is the word had been uttered, a single small word for which the whole of Europe had waited and waited in vain. It was the word 'No' (Ohi) and Greece had uttered it on behalf of all of us at a time when the so-called great powers were all cringing, fawing and trying  to temporize in the face of the Hitlerian Menace."
